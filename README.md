## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was very similar in both approach and design concepts as my [first piece]() but it really helped solidify the concepts well enough. I was able to re-enforce the flexgrid within the "plan item" area. I do think this was easier than the first task I did because this does not scale, the desktop version is the same as the mobile version. With the exception of background image which honestly is very easy to overlook.

### Continued development

This was fun just like the other project, but I am looking forward to trying something a little tougher so I can grow a little.
